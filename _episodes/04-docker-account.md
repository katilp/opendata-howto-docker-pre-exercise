## Container image registries

A container registry is a repository used to store and access container images.
The default registry for docker container images is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
 
No account is needed to download container images from Docker Hub. But when you create a Docker account of your own, you can push your own images to Docker Hub and make them available to others.
