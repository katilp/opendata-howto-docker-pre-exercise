Let's learn about Docker and why we're using it!

Regardless of what you encounter in this lesson, the definitive guide is any 
official documentation provided by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

> ## What is Docker?
>
> From the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
>
> *A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.*
>
> In short, Docker allows a user to work in a computing environment that has been *frozen* with respect
> to interdependent libraries and code and related tools. This means that you can use the same software
> that analysts were using 10 years ago (for example) without downloading all the relevant 10-year-old
> libraries. :)

> ## What can I learn here?
>
> As much as we'd like, we can't give you a *complete* overview of Docker. However, we do hope to explain
> why we run Docker in the way we do so that you gain some understanding. More specifically, we'll
> be showing you how to set up Docker for not just this workshop, but for interfacing with open data in general
